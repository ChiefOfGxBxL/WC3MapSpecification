# Game Configuration Format

The .wgc file can be loaded by starting the game with `-loadfile testconfig.wgc`. This file is generated by WorldEditor's AI testing function and its most important feature is to allow game speeds faster than 100% (practically no limit observed).

**Note:**

Reforged uses Unicode-aware WinAPI, the file paths can contain non-ASCII characters.

Older versions (tested 1.27) cannot properly process Unicode paths in strings in this file, you must use only ASCII characters.
