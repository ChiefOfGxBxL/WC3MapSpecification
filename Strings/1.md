# Warcraft Strings Format

This is a plain-text format that defines text strings used by a map.

These strings are referenced via `TRIGSTR_<ID>` placeholders. For example, a string that
exactly matches `TRIGSTR_3` is instead displayed as `Nondescript` (see below).

The purpose of this format is to allow a [single source of truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth)
for texts (to avoid duplication) and to allow translations for maps (multi-language maps).

The file is always named `war3map.wts` and is looked up at the typical resource locations,
respecting the game's locale (see MPQ locale), usually found at `map_root/war3map.wts`.

## File structure:

This file is plain-text in UTF-8, beginning with a [BOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark#UTF-8):
`\xEF\xBB\xBF`. Line-endings are Windows-style `\r\n`.

Strings are defined consecutively, with numeric constants used between `<brackets>`.
The numbers are not static between map versions and are generated by WorldEditor when the map is saved.

This format was first seen in ROC Beta v120, corresponding to "[w3i](../Info/0-31.md)" format version 15.
The exact game version is unknown. It has not changed since.

```
STRING <ID>
{
[string value]
}
```

Example:
```
STRING 1
{
Just another Warcraft III map 2
}

STRING 2
{
Any
}

STRING 3
{
Nondescript
}
```
